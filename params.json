{"name":"Unofficial Monstercat Connect Desktop App","tagline":"Unofficial Monstercat Connect Desktop app for Mac and Windows","body":"### Unofficial Monstercat Connect Desktop App\r\n\r\nThis project stemmed from my love of Monstercat Connect and my frustration with the various chrome extensions for media key mappings that just don't work :c\r\n\r\nSo I threw this together in [electron](https://github.com/atom/electron), and it works pretty well!\r\n\r\nAll it does is open a chromium window to [https://connect.monstercat.com](https://connect.monstercat.com) and binds the media keys to the play/pause, next and previous buttons, and clicks the buttons using JS.\r\n\r\nThat's literally it.\r\n\r\n### Downloads\r\n\r\nYou can download the first build of the app here:\r\n\r\n* [OS X](https://github.com/joshbalfour/monstercat-connect-desktop-unofficial/releases/download/v0.1-alpha/OS.X.-.Unofficial.Monstercat.Connect.Desktop.dmg)\r\n\r\n* [Windows](https://github.com/joshbalfour/monstercat-connect-desktop-unofficial/releases/download/v0.1-alpha/Windows.-.Unofficial.Monstercat.Connect.Desktop.Setup.exe)\r\n\r\nThe windows build has not been tested yet, but should work\r\n\r\n### Ideas/Issues\r\n\r\nPlease use [the issue tracker](https://github.com/joshbalfour/monstercat-connect-desktop-unofficial/issues/new) to report any bugs you find or any ideas you have that could make the app better!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Thanks\r\n\r\n* To of course Monstercat for existing and making Monstercat Connect awesome!\r\n\r\n* To all the artists who make amazing music that are signed to Monstercat\r\n\r\n* The devs that built Monstercat Connect - The website is really nice and responsive and was easy to interface with, props!\r\n\r\n* To the guys that made [electron](https://github.com/atom/electron), [electron packager](https://github.com/maxogden/electron-packager), and [electron builder](https://github.com/loopline-systems/electron-builder) for making this so easy to build","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
